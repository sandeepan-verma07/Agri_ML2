## 📋 About The Project

Crop Sense addresses a critical challenge in agriculture: the uncertainty of crop yield. By leveraging machine learning and modern APIs, this tool provides farmers with a reliable yield forecast based on their specific farming conditions. More than just a prediction tool, it acts as an agricultural advisor, offering personalized, actionable suggestions generated by Google's Gemini AI to help optimize farming practices and improve productivity.

The application is designed to be user-friendly, with a multi-lingual interface to ensure accessibility for farmers across different regions.

## ✨ Key Features

* **📈 Machine Learning-Powered Yield Prediction**: Utilizes a trained Keras (TensorFlow) model to accurately predict crop yield (in tons/hectare) based on historical data and user inputs.
* **💡 AI-Powered Advisory**: Integrates with the Google Gemini API to generate personalized, actionable advice for farmers based on their predicted yield and input parameters.
* **🌦️ Real-time Rainfall Data**: Automatically fetches annual rainfall data for the selected state and year from the Open-Meteo API, ensuring predictions are based on accurate weather information.
* **🌐 Bilingual Support**: The user interface and AI-generated advice can be translated into Odia, making the tool accessible to local farmers.
* **👤 User Authentication**: A simple, mock OTP-based login system to distinguish users, along with a "Continue as Guest" option.
* **📝 Anonymous Data Collection**: Guest user predictions are saved anonymously to a CSV file, which can be used to further improve the model over time.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The application follows a simple, powerful workflow:

1.  **User Input**: The farmer enters key parameters into the sidebar, including Crop, State, Season, Year, Area, Fertilizer usage, and Pesticide usage.
2.  **Data Enrichment**: The app calls the Open-Meteo API to fetch the total annual rainfall for the selected location and year.
3.  **Prediction**: The input data is fed into a pre-trained machine learning pipeline. This pipeline preprocesses the data and uses a neural network to predict the crop yield.
4.  **AI Advisory**: The user's input data and the predicted yield are sent to the Google Gemini API. Gemini analyzes this profile and generates a concise list of actionable recommendations.
5.  **Display & Translation**: The predicted yield and the AI-generated advice are displayed to the user. An option to translate the advice into Odia is provided.
